# Crud-application-with-Node-Js
Create Simple CRUD Application with NODE JS

1. Go to your folder or create new directory
    ```sh
    mkdir node-api
    ```
    
2. Install JS dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. If you are creating your own module then you have to install some of the dependencies which are required or
you can simply rename by respository and explore.

    a) Express 
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/express
     
      ```sh
      npm install express
      ```
      
    b) Mysql
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql
       
        ```sh
        npm install mysql
        ```
    
     c) Body parser
          https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser
          
         ```sh
          npm install body-parser
         ```
      d) Nodemon
          https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
          
          ```sh
          npm install nodemon
          ```
          
  4) After installing all the packages, do npm init in your command promt. It will ask for the package name and vaersion after you are done with it, package.json file will be created.
  
  5) To start experimenting create index.js in your folder, you can refer my code. After you are done with it, do 
  
     ```sh
         node index.js
         ```
         
     In your localhost try opening the url of your port e.g http://localhost:3000
